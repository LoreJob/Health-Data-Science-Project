# 1 - First Paragraph

**For the project i offer to consider the following topic: 'Young Adults Aged 18-24 Who Had Ever Used an Electronic Nicotine have poor general health and more likely to have asthma diagnoses'**

Comment by Giuseppe:

(I think this topic is too specific and the dataset will not allow us to explore it deeply.
We would need to have information on older persons that have asthma and their smoking habits when they were young)

I propose we chose a more general topic:

<hr>

**The central question we want to answer is: what are the negative effects of smoking?**

We will look at the association between smoking and health related issues. We 
will also look at some mental health indicators and how they relate to smoking
habits.

Things to do: 
- 1 Introduction
- 2 Exploratory analysis: go deep into the dataset analyzing the most important
    variables.
- 3 Effect of smoking/nicotine on physical health: understand how much is dangerous 
    the abuse of smoke for the Pysichal healt
- 4 Effect of smoking/nicotine on mental health:understand how much is dangerous 
    the abuse of smoke for the mental healt
- 5 Conclusion
